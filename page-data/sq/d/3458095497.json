Currently, as no commercial continuum robot platform is available, a large variety of early-stage prototypes exists. These prototypes are developed by individual research groups and are often used for a single publication. Thus, a significant amount of time is devoted to creating proprietary hardware and software hindering the development of a common platform, and shifting away scarce time and efforts from the main research challenges.\n\nWe address this problem by proposing an open-source actuation module, which can be used to build different types of continuum robots. It consists of a high-torque brushless electric motor, a high resolution optical encoder, and a low-gear-ratio transmission. For this letter, we create three different types of continuum robots. In addition, we illustrate, for the first time, that continuum robots built with our actuation module can proprioceptively detect external forces. Consequently, our approach opens untapped and under-investigated research directions related to the dynamics and advanced control of continuum robots, where sensing the generalized flow and effort is mandatory. Besides that, we democratize continuum robots research by providing open-source software and hardware with our initiative called the Open Continuum Robotics Project, to increase the accessibility and reproducibility of advanced methods.","arxiv":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11850","authors":["RGrassman","CShentu","@me","Puspita Triana Dewi","JBK"],"bibtex":"@ARTICLE{10.3389/frobt.2024.1272403,\n\tAUTHOR={Grassmann, Reinhard M. and Shentu, Chengnan and Hamoda, Taqi and Dewi, Puspita Triana and Burgner-Kahrs, Jessica},\n\tTITLE={Open continuum robotics–one actuation module to create them all},\n\tJOURNAL={Frontiers in Robotics and AI},\n\tVOLUME={11},\n\tYEAR={2024},\n\tURL={https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1272403},\n\tDOI={10.3389/frobt.2024.1272403},\n\tISSN={2296-9144}\n}","doi":"10.3389/frobt.2024.1272403","journal":"Frontiers in Robotics and AI","pdf":{"publicURL":"/static/60a8602b0fa68ea24aad63a7c93152e8/Open Continuum Robotics – One Actuation Module to Create them All.pdf"},"published":"2024-01-19","publisher":"Frontiers","title":"Open Continuum Robotics – One Actuation Module to Create them All","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1272403/full","website":"https://www.opencontinuumrobotics.com/","tags":["design","open-source","continuum robots","torque control"],"preview":{"publicURL":"/static/44121488a20340c4ff53e58e96d985d2/one-actuation-module.gif","childImageSharp":null}}]}}}
